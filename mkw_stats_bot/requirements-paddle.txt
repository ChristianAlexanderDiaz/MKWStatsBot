# Optional PaddleOCR dependencies
# Install only if you want to enable the experimental PaddleOCR engine
# Note: Requires significant additional disk space and may conflict with headless deployments

paddlepaddle>=3.1.0
paddleocr>=3.1.0

# RAILWAY/DOCKER FIX: PaddleOCR automatically installs opencv-python which requires libGL.so.1
# This causes "cannot open shared object file" errors in headless environments
# Solution: Force installation of headless version after PaddleOCR
opencv-contrib-python-headless>=4.5.0

# Alternative manual fix if still having issues:
# 1. pip uninstall opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
# 2. pip install opencv-contrib-python-headless
