# MKWStatsBot - Project Plan & Roadmap

## Project Overview

**Mario Kart World Statistics Discord Bot** - A Discord bot that automatically processes race result images using OCR to track comprehensive clan statistics and player performance.

### Current Features
- **Automatic OCR Processing**: Upload race result images and get automatic player detection
- **Clan Member Recognition**: Intelligent nickname resolution (e.g., "Cyn" → "Cynical")
- **War-Based Statistics**: Track averages per war (12 races = 1 war), supporting partial wars
- **Score History**: Complete tracking of individual race scores for each player
- **Manual Editing**: Edit OCR results before saving with intuitive commands
- **Real-time Stats**: View player rankings, recent sessions, and detailed statistics

### Current Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Framework**: Discord.py 2.0+
- **Database**: SQLite (production-ready structure)
- **OCR**: Tesseract with OpenCV preprocessing
- **Structure**: Modular design with clean separation of concerns

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Migration Strategy
1. **Dual-Write Phase**: Run both SQLite and PostgreSQL simultaneously
2. **Data Validation**: Ensure data consistency between databases
3. **Gradual Migration**: Move read operations to PostgreSQL incrementally
4. **Cutover**: Switch to PostgreSQL as primary database
5. **Cleanup**: Remove SQLite dependencies

### Cloud Provider Comparison
| Provider | Pros | Cons | Cost |
|----------|------|------|------|
| Railway | Simple setup, PostgreSQL included | Limited advanced features | $5-20/month |
| AWS RDS | Full-featured, enterprise-grade | Complex setup, higher cost | $15-50/month |
| Google Cloud SQL | Good balance of features/cost | Learning curve | $10-30/month |

### Resume-Worthy Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Backend Development**: Python, Discord.py, RESTful APIs
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL, query optimization, migrations
- **Cloud Services**: AWS/Google Cloud, database-as-a-service
