# Optional PaddleOCR dependencies
# Install only if you want to enable the experimental PaddleOCR engine
# Note: Requires significant additional disk space and may conflict with headless deployments

paddlepaddle>=3.1.0
paddleocr>=3.1.0

# Note: PaddleOCR may install opencv-python which conflicts with opencv-python-headless
# If you encounter libGL.so.1 errors in Docker/Railway, you may need to:
# 1. Uninstall opencv-python: pip uninstall opencv-python
# 2. Reinstall headless version: pip install opencv-python-headless
